# DevOps Free Project — Flask + Docker + GitHub Actions

A minimal DevOps demo project showcasing CI automation, containerization, and unit testing using a simple Flask API.
Designed to demonstrate practical DevOps fundamentals in a clean, production-style structure.

---

## Features
- Flask API — small web endpoint for testing container behavior
- Dockerized environment — reproducible runtime with dependencies included
- Pytest unit tests — verifies application logic
- GitHub Actions CI — automated testing, Docker build, and container health-check
- Lightweight, easy-to-read structure suited for reviewing DevOps skills

## CI Pipeline Overview
GitHub Actions workflow (`ci.yml`) automatically:

1. Checks out code  
2. Installs dependencies  
3. Runs unit tests (`pytest`)  
4. Builds Docker image  
5. Starts the container  
6. Performs a health-check to verify the app responds correctly

This simulates a basic but realistic CI flow.
